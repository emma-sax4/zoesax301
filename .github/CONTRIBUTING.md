# Contributing

To contribute, please follow this process:

Fork this repository: https://github.com/emma-sax4/zoesax301.github.io/fork

| With GitHub UI | On your computer with Git |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Make your first change | Make sure you have this repository cloned to your machine and then create your feature branch:<br>`git checkout -b my-new-feature-branch` |
| When you're ready to commit your first change, make a new branch and name it appropriately | Make your first few changes |
| Click that green `Commit changes` button | Commit and push your changes:<br>`git commit -am "Add some feature" && git push` |
| Make a new pull request for your new branch (GitHub UI might automatically direct you to do this) | Continue making changes and committing/pushing them (unless you leave your feature branch, all new commits will be automatically added to your branch) |
| Continue making changes to your pull request/branch (navigate to the main repository page, switch to your feature branch, and then continue making whatever changes you'd like) | When you're satisfied, make a pull request to this repository in the UI |

To see what your changes look like, follow the instructions in the [Running Locally](https://github.com/emma-sax4/zoesax301.github.io/blob/master/README.md#running-locally) section of the README. If you've been working on GitHub directly up until this point, you may need to switch over to a computer and clone the repository and branch to do this.

When you're absolutely ready for me to look at your pull request, please request a Code Review from me in the pull request.

If I don't comment or start looking at the pull request in a couple of days, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:emma.sax4@gmail.com).
