# Contributing

To contribute, please follow this process:

1. Fork this repository: https://github.com/emma-sax4/zoesax301.github.io/fork
2. Make your changes on a feature branch:

  | With GitHub UI | On your computer with Git |
  |----------------|---------------------------|
  | Make your first change. | Make sure you have this repository cloned to your machine and then create your feature branch. <br>`git checkout -b my-new-feature-branch` |
  | When you're ready to commit your first change, make a new branch and name it appropriately. | Make your first few changes. |
  | Click that green `Commit changes` button. | Commit and push your changes.<br>`git commit -am "Add some feature" && git push` |
  | Make a new pull request for your new branch (GitHub UI should automatically direct you to do this). | Continue making changes and committing/pushing them (unless you leave your feature branch, all new commits will be automatically added to your branch). |
  | Continue making changes to your pull request/branch (navigate to the main repository page, switch to your feature branch, and then continue making whatever changes you'd like). | When you're satisfied, make a pull request to this repository in the GitHub UI. |

3. Verify TravisCI passes on your pull request. The test configuration lives inside the [`.travis.yml`](https://github.com/emma-sax4/zoesax301.github.io/blob/master/.travis.yml) file. Read more about this repository's tests [here](https://github.com/emma-sax4/zoesax301.github.io#running-tests).
4. Check the site looks like how you expect it to look. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/emma-sax4/zoesax301.github.io#running-locally) to get your computer running the site locally. If you've been working on GitHub UI up until this point, you may need to switch over to a computer and clone the repository and branch to do this.
5. When you're absolutely ready for me to look at your pull request, please request a Code Review from me in the pull request.

If I don't comment or start looking at the pull request in a few days, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:emma.sax4@gmail.com).

Happy coding! ðŸ¤—
