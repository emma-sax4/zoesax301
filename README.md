# zoesax301.github.io [![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/8d0311705c19a9581553/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/emma-sax4/zoesax301.github.io/maintainability) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/emma-sax4/zoesax301.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/emma-sax4/zoesax301.github.io)

#### Live site at: [https://emma-sax4.github.io/zoesax301.github.io](https://emma-sax4.github.io/zoesax301.github.io)

This page was originally generated using the [Architect Theme](https://github.com/jasonlong/architect-theme) theme by [Jason Long](https://twitter.com/jasonlong), and now uses Jekyll.

Currently, this site is monitored and maintained by Zoe's sister, [Emma](https://github.com/emma-sax4). Any questions about the site should be directed to her.

## Running Locally

To run locally, run:
```
gem install bundler
bundle install
jekyll serve
```

Images may not show up properly while running locally, because they hard-code the name of the GitHub repo (`zoesax301.github.io`) into the links. This is because it is hosted as an additional site on my normal GitHub site, hence the URL becoming <code>https://emma-sax4.github.io/<i>zoesax301.github.io</i></code>.
